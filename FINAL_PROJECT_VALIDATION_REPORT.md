**Critical Gaps to Address**:
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Major functionality gaps
- **Test Validation**: Claims not supported by working test execution
- **User Experience**: Incomplete workflows, limited mobile optimization
- **Production Readiness**: 6-8 weeks additional effort required

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Immediate Focus**: Fix test infrastructure and validate actual capabilities
2. **Timeline Adjustment**: Plan for realistic 6-8 week completion timeline
3. **Resource Allocation**: Deploy 4-agent primary team with integration focus
4. **Quality Gates**: Implement evidence-based completion criteria
5. **Stakeholder Management**: Provide transparent progress reporting

### Success Probability Assessment

With proper resource allocation and realistic timeline expectations:
