# DwayBank Sub-Agent Integration Guide

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### Phase 1: Sub-Agent Architecture (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ 11 specialized financial sub-agents created
- ‚úÖ Agent orchestration configuration established
- ‚úÖ Tool access permissions and MCP server preferences defined

### Phase 2: Task Master Integration (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Task Master configuration updated for sub-agent support
- ‚úÖ Agent management system with workload balancing implemented
- ‚úÖ Command mapping system for seamless integration

## üîÑ Quick Implementation Steps

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration

1. **Enable Sub-Agents in Claude Code**
   ```bash
   # Use the /agents command to register the sub-agents
   /agents
   # Import each agent from .claude/agents/ directory
   ```

2. **Test Agent Selection**
   ```javascript
   // Task Master will now automatically route tasks to specialized agents
   const agentManager = new DwayBankAgentManager(config);
   const assignment = await agentManager.assignTask(task, context);
   ```

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

1. **Agent Performance Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test each agent with sample financial tasks
   # Architect agent: "Design account management system"
   # Security agent: "Audit payment processing security"
   # Frontend agent: "Create trading interface component"
   ```

2. **Integration Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test Task Master + Sub-Agent coordination
   # Verify MCP server coordination
   # Validate resource allocation
   ```

## üìã Usage Examples

### 1. Financial API Development
```javascript
// Task Master automatically routes to backend + security agents
"Implement secure payment processing API with PCI DSS compliance"
// Result: dwaybank-backend (primary) + dwaybank-security (supporting)
```

### 2. Trading Interface Development
```javascript
// Routes to frontend + performance + QA agents
"Create responsive trading dashboard with real-time data"
// Result: dwaybank-frontend (primary) + dwaybank-performance + dwaybank-qa
```

### 3. Security Audit
```javascript
// Routes to security + analyzer + scribe agents
"Conduct comprehensive financial system security audit"
// Result: dwaybank-security (primary) + dwaybank-analyzer + dwaybank-scribe
```

### 4. Architecture Review
```javascript
// Routes to architect + security + performance agents
"Review and improve banking system architecture for scalability"
// Result: dwaybank-architect (primary) + dwaybank-security + dwaybank-performance
```

## üîß Configuration Files Created
