### Coalition Formation Algorithm
```markdown
## Coalition Formation Process

### Phase 1: Task Analysis and Decomposition
1. **Task Complexity Assessment**
   - Analyze task requirements and complexity score (0.0-1.0)
   - Identify required domain expertise and specializations
   - Assess resource requirements and timeline constraints
   - Determine quality and compliance requirements

2. **Agent Capability Mapping**
   - Map task requirements to agent capabilities and specializations
   - Assess agent availability and current workload
   - Consider agent performance history and success rates
   - Evaluate agent collaboration patterns and compatibility

### Phase 2: Optimal Coalition Selection
1. **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**
   - Generate initial population of agent combinations
   - Evaluate fitness based on capability match, performance, and resource efficiency
   - Apply genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation)
   - Evolve population over multiple generations for optimal coalition

2. **Coalition Validation and Refinement**
   - Validate coalition against task requirements and constraints
   - Assess resource allocation and potential conflicts
   - Refine coalition composition based on current system state
   - Finalize coalition with clear roles and responsibilities

### Phase 3: Coalition Coordination and Management
1. **Workflow Orchestration**
   - Define workflow stages and dependencies between agents
   - Establish communication protocols and coordination mechanisms
   - Set quality gates and validation checkpoints
   - Initialize monitoring and performance tracking

2. **Dynamic Coalition Management**
   - Monitor coalition performance and progress
   - Identify bottlenecks and resource conflicts
   - Adjust coalition composition and resource allocation as needed
   - Manage agent replacement and workflow continuation
