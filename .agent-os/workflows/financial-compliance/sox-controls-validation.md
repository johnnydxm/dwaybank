## üéØ SOX Compliance Overview

### Sarbanes-Oxley Act Requirements
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR). For DwayBank's financial systems, this includes comprehensive IT General Controls (ITGCs) and Application Controls that ensure accurate financial data processing and reporting.

### Key SOX Requirements for Financial Systems
- **IT General Controls**: Access controls, change management, computer operations, program development
- **Application Controls**: Input controls, processing controls, output controls, master file controls
- **Management Assessment**: Annual assessment of internal control effectiveness
- **Auditor Attestation**: Independent auditor assessment of internal controls

## üîç SOX Compliance Testing and Validation

### Control Testing Methodology
```markdown
## SOX Control Testing Framework

### 1. Design Effectiveness Testing
**Objective**: Validate control design adequacy

#### Testing Procedures:
1. **Control Documentation Review**
   - Review control descriptions and procedures
   - Validate control objectives and risk mitigation
   - Assess control design adequacy and coverage
   - Document control gaps and deficiencies

2. **Process Walkthrough**
   - Perform end-to-end process walkthrough
   - Validate control integration and effectiveness
   - Identify control dependencies and relationships
   - Document process flows and control points

### 2. Operating Effectiveness Testing
**Objective**: Validate control operation throughout the period

#### Testing Procedures:
1. **Control Execution Testing**
   - Test control execution for sample periods
   - Validate control performance and effectiveness
   - Assess control consistency and reliability
   - Document exceptions and deficiencies

2. **Exception Analysis**
